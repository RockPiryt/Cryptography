## Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```
3. Run the program using the Go command with flags. Example:
    ```bash
    go run main.go -c -e
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    ./cezar.exe -c -e    
    ```
